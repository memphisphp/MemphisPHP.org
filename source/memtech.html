Memphis has a great scene if you are in the Tech industry. There are quite a few user groups to visit. If you are not already involved with a local user group, you should get involved. There are a lot of groups in Memphis and there are some really great people participating in them. If you are already a part of a local user group, I challenge you to visit other user groups and help spread the word of your group to others. If there isn't already a user group for you,<a href="mailto:joe@joeferguson.me"> contact us</a>. We'll do what we can to help you start one.

The tech scene in Memphis is what we make it. Let's make it awesome.
