            This month we will have a very special guest: Juliette Reinders Folmer:
        </p>
        <p>
            So you think you know PHP ? But do you really ?
        </p>
        <p>
            We all compare and test data on nearly every other line in our code, be it input validation, an if-statement, a switch or determining what to display and how. So of course we are all experts on how to do these tests and comparisons…. Or are we?
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, come and join in the fun for the Big “Why equal doesn’t equal” Quiz, test your knowledge and learn about defensive programming and the quirks of a loose type programming language along the way.
