        <h2>php[tek] 2016 St. Louis â€” May 23-27, 2016</h2>
        <p>
            Wanted to go to a PHP Conference but always frustrated that they're just outside easy driving distance of Memphis? Me too!
        </p>
        <p>
            The fine folks at <a href="http://www.phparch.com" target="_blank">php[architect]</a> have solved this problem for us. The annual <a href="http://tek.phparch.com" target="_blank">php[tek]</a> conference has been moved to St. Louis, MO!
            With St. Louis being a mere ~4 hour drive away this is an easy drive to an amazing conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have never been to a PHP conference php[tek] is a great one to be your first.
            Our own Jeremy Kendall started this user group after attending php[tek]. My own first PHP conference was php[tek] 2014 and it was a blast.
            They have an <a href="https://tek.phparch.com/schedule/" target="_blank">amazing schedule</a> (I admit I'm biased - I'm a speaker)
            and they're doing a special 2 day "PHP Essentials" training session for those new to PHP.
            I'll be giving my Laravel training session and a regular talk during the conference.
        </p>
        <p>
            To make the offer even better they have offered me a special price for anyone coming from the Memphis area. You have to contact me and I'll put you in touch!

        <h2>php[cruise] Out of Baltimore, MD - July 17-24, 2016</h2>
        <p>
            After you've made your plans to join me at php[tek] in May, go ahead and make you reservations to <a href="https://cruise.phparch.com/" target="_blank">join me on a boat</a>!
            This special event won't happen again anytime soon and our good friend Cal Evans will be giving a one time only talk on the cruise.
            Bring the family or friends along, there will be days in ports and days at sea.
